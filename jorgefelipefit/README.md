# React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind

This project is a replication of [jorgefelipefit.com.br](https://jorgefelipefit.com.br/), originally built with WordPress by me.

The goal of this version is to create a simplified copy, focusing on the website's structure. Please note that this copy does not include images or colors.
